        <h3>Clicks of Unicorns ðŸ¦„</h3>
        <p>
          A fun and simple Chrome extension that shoots emojis from the user's cursor when clicked. the extension uses
          vanilla js and CSS to find the location of the mouse when clicked, inserting emoji divs with random
          trajectories, and removing them after the animation ends. The extension is slim enough so it doesn't effect
          the performance, and uses a popup for emoji selection.
        </p>

        <h3>100 CSS properties</h3>
        <p>
          In 2022 I challenged myself to learn and create something with a different random CSS property every workday.
          The exercise was to learn about obscure properties and dive deeper into the more frequently used ones. At this
          point Jan 2023 I did more than 30 properties.

        <h3>Codepen challenges</h3>
        <p>
          When I had some extra time I made a pen for the Codepen challenges. In 2022 I made two pens and both of them
          were retweeted by the official Codepan twitter.

        <h3>H3 logo using only h3</h3>
        <p>
          A popular youtube channel named H3H3 production inspired me to recreate their logo using only an h3 HTML
          element. The CSS uses a lot of gradients and sudo elements with content. Works with any resolution and is
          centered.

        <h3>IT'S NOT WORKING!!!</h3>
        <p>
          A simple idea of a big button that you can spam-click to let out your rage as a developer. The small project
          was adopted as a marketing site for Loadmill's URL example merch.
